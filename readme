For the configuration, first thing to do is putting below files into /etc/squid folder
* cwf_redirect.py
* fls_lookup.py
* cwf_redirect_properties.conf
* category_definitions.conf
* GenerateUUID/createUUID.py (as it is in the folder)
* GenerateUUID/generateUID.sh (as it is in the folder)

Please, make sure that python installed and "/usr/bin/python"( most of the linux distributions have build-in support for this )

After putting this script into /etc/squid, squid.conf at the same directory should be changed by adding these lines.
    redirect_program /usr/bin/python /etc/squid/cwf_redirect.py
    redirect_children 5

And also you need to download requests for python.
To install Requests,run this command in your terminal:
    $ apt-get install python-requests

cwf_redirect_properties.conf consists of two parts.
	 One of the parts([properties]) includes url,invalid url(which is the redirection page if any site is blocked categories).
	 The other part [categories] includes category name with enabled or disabled information.(Enabled = 1,Disabled = 0)
category_definitions.conf consist of category_ids and respective category_labels to use in cwf_redirect_properties.conf file.
For most of the times you do not need to change category_definitions file unless a new category is created or changed.
To block any site that belongs to a category for example "Media Sharing" , you need to change the enable/disable information:
Media Sharing=1
to
Media Sharing=0
in file cwf_redirect_properties.conf

After all these instructions applied, squid service should be restarted with:
	systemctl restart squid

By default squid is listening on port 3128. Using configurations in the attached screenshot any browser can be used for proxying.
The proxy configuration can be checked from the screenshot: squid_proxy_configuration.png


In addition,

run script for just once.
    ./etc/squid/GenerateUUID/generateUID.sh

After that UUID is written in uuid.txt by this script.
